    <h2>Privacy</h2>
<p>Privacy is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively.

When something is private to a person, it usually means that something is inherently special or sensitive to them. The domain of privacy partially overlaps with security, which can include the concepts of appropriate use and protection of information. Privacy may also take the form of bodily integrity. The right not to be subjected to unsanctioned invasions of privacy by the government, corporations, or individuals is part of many countries' privacy laws, and in some cases, constitutions.

In the business world, a person may volunteer personal details, including for advertising, in order to receive some kinds of benefit. Public figures may be subject to rules on the public interest. Personal information which is voluntarily shared but subsequently stolen or misused can lead to identity theft.

The concept of universal individual privacy is a modern concept primarily associated with Western culture, British and North American in particular, and remained virtually unknown in some cultures until recent times. Most cultures, however, recognize the ability of individuals to withhold certain parts of their personal information from wider society, such as closing the door to one's home.</p>

<p>Control over one's personal information is the concept that "privacy is the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others." Generally, a person who has <a href="/wiki/Implied_consent" title="Implied consent">consensually formed an interpersonal relationship</a> with another person is not considered "protected" by privacy rights with respect to the person they are in the relationship with. <sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESolove200824_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTESolove200824-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Charles_Fried" title="Charles Fried">Charles Fried</a> said that "Privacy is not simply an absence of information about us in the minds of others; rather it is the control we have over information about ourselves.

<p>Alan Westin defined four states—or experiences—of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, and reserve. Solitude is a physical separation from others.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Intimacy is a "close, relaxed, and frank relationship between two or more individuals" that results from the seclusion of a pair or small group of individuals.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_10-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Anonymity is the "desire of individuals for times of 'public privacy.'"<sup id="cite_ref-:0_10-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Lastly, reserve is the "creation of a psychological barrier against unwanted intrusion"; this creation of a psychological barrier requires others to respect an individual's need or desire to restrict communication of information concerning himself or herself.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_10-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>In addition to the psychological barrier of reserve, Kirsty Hughes identified three more kinds of privacy barriers: physical, behavioral, and normative. Physical barriers, such as walls and doors, prevent others from accessing and experiencing the individual.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:1-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> (In this sense, "accessing" an individual includes accessing personal information about him or her.)<sup id="cite_ref-:1_11-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:1-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Behavioral barriers communicate to others—verbally, through language, or non-verbally, through personal space, body language, or clothing—that an individual does not want them to access or experience him or her.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_11-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:1-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Lastly, normative barriers, such as laws and social norms, restrain others from attempting to access or experience an individual.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_11-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:1-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Privacy is sometimes defined as an option to have secrecy. Richard Posner said that privacy is the right of people to "conceal information about themselves that others might use to their disadvantage". <sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESolove200821_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTESolove200821-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>In various legal contexts, when privacy is described as secrecy, a conclusion if privacy is secrecy then rights to privacy do not apply for any information which is already publicly disclosed.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESolove200822–23_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTESolove200822–23-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> When privacy-as-secrecy is discussed, it is usually imagined to be a selective kind of secrecy in which individuals keep some information secret and private while they choose to make other information public and not private.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESolove200822–23_14-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTESolove200822–23-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Privacy may be understood as a necessary precondition for the development and preservation of personhood. Jeffrey Reiman defined privacy in terms of a recognition of one's ownership of his or her physical and mental reality and a moral right to his or her self-determination.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:2-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> Through the "social ritual" of privacy, or the social practice of respecting an individual's privacy barriers, the social group communicates to the developing child that he or she has exclusive moral rights to his or her body—in other words, he or she has moral ownership of his or her body.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_15-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:2-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> This entails control over both active (physical) and cognitive appropriation, the former being control over one's movements and actions and the latter being control over who can experience one's physical existence and when.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_15-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:2-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Alternatively, Stanley Benn defined privacy in terms of a recognition of oneself as a subject with agency—as an individual with the capacity to choose.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:3-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> Privacy is required to exercise choice.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_16-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:3-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> Overt observation makes the individual aware of himself or herself as an object with a "determinate character" and "limited probabilities."<sup id="cite_ref-:3_16-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:3-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> Covert observation, on the other hand, changes the conditions in which the individual is exercising choice without his or her knowledge and consent.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_16-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:3-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>In addition, privacy may be viewed as a state that enables autonomy, a concept closely connected to that of personhood. According to Joseph Kufer, an autonomous self-concept entails a conception of oneself as a "purposeful, self-determining, responsible agent" and an awareness of one's capacity to control the boundary between self and other—that is, to control who can access and experience him or her and to what extent.<sup id="cite_ref-:4_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:4-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> Furthermore, others must acknowledge and respect the self's boundaries—in other words, they must respect the individual's privacy.<sup id="cite_ref-:4_17-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:4-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>The studies of psychologists such as Jean Piaget and Victor Tausk show that, as children learn that they can control who can access and experience them and to what extent, they develop an autonomous self-concept.<sup id="cite_ref-:4_17-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:4-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> In addition, studies of adults in particular institutions, such as Erving Goffman's study of "total institutions" such as prisons and mental institutions,<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> suggest that systemic and routinized deprivations or violations of privacy deteriorate one's sense of autonomy over time.<sup id="cite_ref-:4_17-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:4-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Privacy may be understood as a prerequisite for the development of a sense of self-identity. Privacy barriers, in particular, are instrumental in this process. According to Irwin Altman, such barriers "define and limit the boundaries of the self" and thus "serve to help define [the self]."<sup id="cite_ref-:5_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:5-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> This control primarily entails the ability to regulate contact with others.<sup id="cite_ref-:5_19-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:5-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> Control over the "permeability" of the self's boundaries enables one to control what constitutes the self and thus to define what is the self.<sup id="cite_ref-:5_19-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:5-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>In addition, privacy may be seen as a state that fosters personal growth, a process integral to the development of self-identity. Hyman Gross suggested that, without privacy—solitude, anonymity, and temporary releases from social roles—individuals would be unable to freely express themselves and to engage in self-discovery and self-criticism.<sup id="cite_ref-:4_17-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:4-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> Such self-discovery and self-criticism contributes to one's understanding of oneself and shapes one's sense of identity.<sup id="cite_ref-:4_17-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:4-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>

<p>In a way analogous to how the personhood theory imagines privacy as some essential part of being an individual, the intimacy theory imagines privacy to be an essential part of the way that humans have strengthened or <a href="/wiki/Intimate_relationships" class="mw-redirect" title="Intimate relationships">intimate relationships</a> with other humans.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESolove200835_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTESolove200835-20">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> Because part of <a href="/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship" title="Interpersonal relationship">human relationships</a> includes individuals volunteering to self-disclose most if not all personal information, this is one area in which privacy does not apply.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESolove200835_20-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTESolove200835-20">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>

<p>The Internet has brought new concerns about privacy in an age where computers can permanently store records of everything: "where every online photo, status update, Twitter post and blog entry by and about us can be stored forever", writes law professor and author <a href="/wiki/Jeffrey_Rosen_(legal_academic)" title="Jeffrey Rosen (legal academic)">Jeffrey Rosen</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-nytimes1_31-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nytimes1-31">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup>

This concept forms the foundation for fair information practices used by governments globally. Flaherty forwards an idea of privacy as information control, "[i]ndividuals want to be left alone and to exercise some control over how information about them is used".<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46">&#91;46&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Richard Posner and Lawrence Lessig focus on the economic aspects of personal information control. Posner criticizes privacy for concealing information, which reduces market efficiency. For Posner, employment is selling oneself in the labour market, which he believes is like selling a product. Any 'defect' in the 'product' that is not reported is fraud.<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47">&#91;47&#93;</a></sup> For Lessig, privacy breaches online can be regulated through code and law. Lessig claims "the protection of privacy would be stronger if people conceived of the right as a property right", and that "individuals should be able to control information about themselves".<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup>

</p><p>Priscilla Regan believes that individual concepts of privacy have failed philosophically and in policy. She supports a social value of privacy with three dimensions: shared perceptions, public values, and <a href="/wiki/Collectivism" title="Collectivism">collective</a> components. Shared ideas about privacy allows freedom of conscience and diversity in thought. Public values guarantee democratic participation, including freedoms of speech and association, and limits government power. Collective elements describe privacy as collective good that cannot be divided. Regan's goal is to strengthen privacy claims in policy making: "if we did recognize the collective or public-good value of privacy, as well as the common and public value of privacy, those advocating privacy protections would have a stronger basis upon which to argue for its protection".<sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54">&#91;54&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Leslie Regan Shade argues that the human right to privacy is necessary for meaningful democratic participation, and ensures human dignity and autonomy. Privacy depends on norms for how information is distributed, and if this is appropriate. Violations of privacy depend on context. The human right to privacy has precedent in the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Declaration_of_Human_Rights" class="mw-redirect" title="United Nations Declaration of Human Rights">United Nations Declaration of Human Rights</a>: "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."<sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-55">&#91;55&#93;</a></sup> Shade believes that privacy must be approached from a people-centered perspective, and not through the marketplace.<sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-56">&#91;56&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Dr. Eliza Watt, Westminster Law School, University of Westminster in London, UK, proposes application of the International Human Right Law (IHRL) concept of “virtual control” as an approach to deal with extraterritorial mass surveillance by state intelligence agencies.<sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57">&#91;57&#93;</a></sup> Dr. Watt envisions the “virtual control” test, understood as a remote control over the individual's right to privacy of communications, where privacy is recognized under the ICCPR, Article 17.

The initial introduction of privacy law in 1998 extended to the public sector, specifically to Federal government departments, under the Information Privacy Principles.

<p>The privacy paradox is a phenomenon in which online users state that they are concerned about their privacy but behave as if they were not.<sup id="cite_ref-Swartz,_J._2000_90-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Swartz,_J._2000-90">&#91;90&#93;</a></sup> While this term was coined as early as 1998,<sup id="cite_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-91">&#91;91&#93;</a></sup> it wasn't used in its current popular sense until the year 2000.<sup id="cite_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-92">&#91;92&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Swartz,_J._2000_90-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Swartz,_J._2000-90">&#91;90&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Susan B. Barnes similarly used the term “privacy paradox” to refer to the ambiguous boundary between private and public space on social media.<sup id="cite_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-93">&#91;93&#93;</a></sup> When compared to adults, young people tend to disclose more information on social media. However, this does not mean that they are not concerned about their privacy. Susan B. Barnes gave a case in her article: in a television interview about Facebook, a student addressed her concerns about disclosing personal information online. However, when the reporter asked to see her Facebook page, she put her home address, phone numbers, and pictures of her young son on the page.
</p><p>The privacy paradox has been studied and scripted in different research settings. Although several studies have shown this inconsistency between privacy attitudes and behavior among online users, the reason for the paradox still remains unclear.<sup id="cite_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-94">&#91;94&#93;</a></sup> A main explanation for the privacy paradox is that users lack awareness of the risks and the degree of protection.<sup id="cite_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-95">&#91;95&#93;</a></sup> Users may underestimate the harm of disclosing information online.  On the other hand, some researchers argue the privacy paradox comes from lack of technology literacy and from the design of sites.<sup id="cite_ref-96" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-96">&#91;96&#93;</a></sup>  For example, users may not know how to change their <a href="/wiki/Privacy_settings" title="Privacy settings">default settings</a> even though they care about their privacy.  Psychologists particularly pointed out that the privacy paradox occurs because users must trade-off between their privacy concerns and impression management.<sup id="cite_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-97">&#91;97&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Some researchers believe that decision making takes place on irrational level especially when it comes to mobile computing. Mobile applications are built up in a way that decision making is fast. Restricting one's profile on social networks is the easiest way to protect against privacy threats and security intrusions. However, such protection measures are not easily accessible while downloading and installing apps. Even if there would be mechanisms to protect your privacy then most of the users do not have the knowledge or experience to protective behavior.<sup id="cite_ref-Barth_1038–1058_98-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Barth_1038–1058-98">&#91;98&#93;</a></sup> Mobile applications consumers also have very little knowledge of how their personal data are used, they do not rely on the information provided by application vendors on the collection and use of personal data, when they decide which application to download.<sup id="cite_ref-Kokolakis_122–134_99-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kokolakis_122–134-99">&#91;99&#93;</a></sup> Users claim that permissions are important while downloading app, but research shows that users do not value privacy and security related aspects to be important when downloading and installing app. Users value cost, functionality, design, ratings, reviews and downloads more important than requested permissions.<sup id="cite_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-100">&#91;100&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>A study by Zafeiropoulou specifically examined location data, which is a form of personal information increasingly used by mobile applications.<sup id="cite_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-101">&#91;101&#93;</a></sup> Their survey also found evidence that supports the existence of privacy paradox for location data.<sup id="cite_ref-Kokolakis_122–134_99-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kokolakis_122–134-99">&#91;99&#93;</a></sup>  Privacy risk perception in relation to the use of <a href="/wiki/Privacy-enhancing_technologies" title="Privacy-enhancing technologies">privacy-enhancing technologies</a> survey data indicates that a high perception of privacy risk is an insufficient motivator for people to adopt privacy protecting strategies, while knowing they exist.<sup id="cite_ref-Kokolakis_122–134_99-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kokolakis_122–134-99">&#91;99&#93;</a></sup> It also raises a question on what the value of data is, as there is no equivalent of a stock-market for personal information.<sup id="cite_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-102">&#91;102&#93;</a></sup>

<p>The willingness to incur a privacy risk is driven by a complex array of factors including risk attitudes, self-reported value for private information, and general attitudes to privacy (derived from surveys).<sup id="cite_ref-Frik_103-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Frik-103">&#91;103&#93;</a></sup> Experiments aiming to determine the monetary value of several types of personal information indicate low evaluations of personal information.

</p><p>Concrete solutions on how to solve paradoxical behavior still do not exist. Many efforts are focused on processes of decision making like restricting data access permissions during the applications installation. However, nothing that would solve the gap between user intention and behavior. Susanne Barth and Menno D.T. de Jong believe that for users to make more conscious decisions on privacy matters the design needs to be more user oriented. Meaning, the ownership of data related risks will be better perceived if psychological ownership of data is being considered as ‘mine’ rather than ‘not mine’.<sup id="cite_ref-Barth_1038–1058_98-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Barth_1038–1058-98">&#91;98&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>There are many opinions related to privacy paradox. It is also suggested that it should not be considered a paradox anymore. It's maybe more of a privacy dilemma, because people would like to do more but they also want to use services that would not exist without sharing their data. It is suggested to be, that people do understand that they pay with personal data, but believe they get a fair deal.<sup id="cite_ref-2._The_Privacy_Paradox_105-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2._The_Privacy_Paradox-105">&#91;105&#93;</a></sup><br />
